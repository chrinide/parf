The random forests algorithm is one of the best currently known algorithms for classification (and regression analysis), 
able to classify big quantities of data with great accuracy. Also, an algorithm is inherently parallelisable. 
The original algorithm is written in the programming language Fortran 77, 
which is obsolete and does not provide many opportunities that modern programming languages; 
also, the original code is not an example of "clear" programming, and it is very difficult to apply for educational purposes.

As part of this project is proposed adaptation algorithm, appropriate applicability, 
translation of this algorithm in Fortran 90. Unlike Fortran 77, Fortran 90 is strukturirirani parallel programming language, 
and is a program written in it easily run on a parallel infrastructure, and is easy to read, both researchers and students. 
In addition, recently, which is launched (for non-commercial use) free implementation, 
which is the absence of any one of the major obstacles in the implementation of the original algorithm, 
for fear they will not be accepted by the academic community. Creator algorithm, professor emeritus Leo Breiman at Berkeley , 
said he was in correspondence great interest in this idea. 
He confirmed that no one has yet worked on a parallel implementation of his algorithm, and promised his support and help. 
Leo Breiman one of the pioneers in the fields of machine learning and data mining, 
and a co-author of the first major program (CART - Classification and Regression Trees) in the area.
